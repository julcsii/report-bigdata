The main research question can be formulated as follows:

How accurately we can estimate a customer's position given
\begin{itemize}
    \item sequence of mobile network events generated by them (CDR data),
    \item cell tower data (cell map) to obtain location information for the connected cells.
\end{itemize}

Evaluating cellular network event based customer positioning boils down to defining and calculating a distance or (dis)similarity measure between point based trajectories.
